While working on this assignment, I faced challenges with certain functions in the string.h library since I hadnâ€™t used them much before. This made handling strings harder, as I initially tried to write my own solutions. I also struggled with 2D arrays, especially when accessing elements and implementing searches in multiple directions. Understanding the logic to implement specific features, like searching horizontally and vertically within a grid, also required extra effort. Overall, this assignment highlighted areas where I could improve, especially in using string functions and managing 2D arrays.
